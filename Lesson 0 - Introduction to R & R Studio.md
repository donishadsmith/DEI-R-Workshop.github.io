## What is R?

R is a high-level programming language commonly used for data analysis and data visualization. 

Additionally, R, like Python and Javascript, is an interpreted language. This means that the R interpretor reads each line of the program. Each line is read and checked to ensure that the rules of the language have been followed, translated into machine code (0's and 1's) to be executed by the computer, and the output is produced.

```R
print("Hello World!") #Interpretor reads and translates this line first
print("My name is _") #Then the interpretor reads and 
```
```R
[1] "Hello World!"
[1] "My name is _"
```
Because each line is translated and executed one line at a time, if the interpretor detects a syntax error, it will stop executing the program
